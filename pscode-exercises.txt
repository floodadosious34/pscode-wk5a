// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

        PRINT "The number is even."
    ELSE
        PRINT "The number is odd."

END FUNCTION

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

FUNCTION processNumbers
    DECLARE numbers AS ARRAY[5]
    DECLARE total AS NUMBER = 0
    DECLARE average AS NUMBER
    DECLARE minimum AS NUMBER
    DECLARE maximum AS NUMBER

    FOR i FROM 1 TO 5 DO
        PRINT "Enter number " + i + ":"
        READ numbers[i]
        total = total + numbers[i]
